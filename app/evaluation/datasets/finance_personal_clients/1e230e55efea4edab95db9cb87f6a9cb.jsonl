The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is the US government agency responsible for implementing and enforcing these types of sanctions.\n\nComprehensive sanctions, on the other hand, are more broadly based and aim to restrict entire sectors of a country's economy or to impose a broad ban on certain types of activities. Comprehensive sanctions can be used to achieve a variety of foreign policy goals, such as punishing a country for human rights abuses or obstructing US foreign policy.\n\nSectoral sanctions are a type of comprehensive sanction that target specific sectors of a country's economy. These sanctions are intended to have a broader impact on a country's economy and can be used to target key industries such as oil and gas, banking, or transportation. Sectoral sanctions can include restrictions on the import or export of goods or services, as well as restrictions on investment in certain sectors.\n\nAnother type of comprehensive sanction is the ban on US exports to a certain country. This type of sanction can be used to punish a country for engaging in activities that are contrary to US interests, such as selling weapons to terrorist groups or engaging in human rights abuses.\n\nIt's worth noting that the US has a wide range of tools at its disposal when it comes to imposing economic sanctions, and the specific type of sanction used will depend on the particular situation and the goals of the US government.
